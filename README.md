# React Model-Update-View

A React microframework for pure state management and managed side effects. Inspired by the [Elm architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/), no Redux needed. No dependencies other than React itself.

**This is currently in the beta phase! After gathering some feedback it will be bumped to stable soon.**

- âœ… **all-in-one:** State management and effect handling out of the box.
- âœ… **no redux libraries needed:** No redux, react-redux, redux-thunk, redux-sage, redux-loop etc needed.
- âœ… **zero dependencies:** Has no dependencies other than React itself.
- âœ… **lightweight:** The implementation is in a single file of ~1KB minified and a bit over ~100 lines of code including comments. (Check on [bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com/package/react-model-update-view))
- âœ… **typed:** This library ships with TypeScript Types.

## Why?

React is univeral but leaves a lot of open questions regarding how to manage application state and side-effects.
For this reason a multitude of libraries like `redux`, `redux-thunk`, `redux-saga` etc have emerged, which all come with a dependency footprint, boiler plate code, and up front planning on which libraries to select.
Wouldn't it be nice to have a simple setup that works for (almost) all cases with a single dependency and minimal boiler plate?

So this library is for you if
- you like to have your application state and side-effects managed in a clean way
- you're tired of wiring together multiple (redux-)libraries
- wanna keep dependencies to a minimum
- keep your app simple as it grows

## What is Model-Update-View?

This pattern (also known as the Elm architecture) breaks down an app into 4 main functions.

function | description
---      |  ----    
**init** | A function which returns the initial value for your model
**update** | A function that gets messages, the current model and computes and returns a new model and a list of effects (reducer). Runs whenever events happen.
**view** |A function that gets the model and a message dispatching function and returns some JSX.
**subscriptions** | A function that sets up event listeners to events external to the application like timers, sockets, or clicks on the document and dispatches new messages. Runs whenever the model changes.

## Installing

```sh
npm i -D react-model-update-view
```

## Example usage

See the `examples/` folder.

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
// eslint-disable import/no-unresolved
import { createApp, useSendMsg } from "react-model-update-view";

function documentClickSubscription(sendMsg) {
  const listener = () => sendMsg({ type: "documentClick" });
  document.addEventListener("click", listener);
  return () => {
    // return unsubscribe function
    document.removeEventListener("click", listener);
  };
}

function logEffect(text) {
  return (sendMsg) => console.log(text);
}

const App = createApp({
  init() {
    return 0;
  },
  update(msg, model) {
    console.log({ msg });
    switch (msg.type) {
      case "plus":
        return [model + 1, [logEffect("plus")]];
      case "minus":
        return [model - 1, [logEffect("minus")]];
      case "reset":
        return [0, []];
      case "documentClick":
        return [model + 5, []];
      default:
        throw new Error(`Unknown msg "${msg.type}"`);
    }
  },
  view(model, sendMsg) {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2> {model}</h2>
        <button type="button" onClick={() => sendMsg({ type: "plus" })}>
          +
        </button>
        <button type="button" onClick={() => sendMsg({ type: "minus" })}>
          -
        </button>
        <ResetButton />
      </div>
    );
  },
  subscriptions(model) {
    // listen to document clicks, unsubscribe if model is >= 30
    return model < 30 ? [documentClickSubscription] : [];
  },
});

function ResetButton() {
  const sendMsg = useSendMsg();
  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={() => sendMsg({ type: "reset" })}>
      Reset
    </button>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<App />);
```
## FAQs

### What is `model`, `sendMsg` and `msg`?

If you're familiar with redux or React's `useReducer` hook, those are different names for things you already know.
- `model` -> `state`
- `msg` -> `action`
- `sendMsg()` -> `dispatch()`

They are conceptually the same thing. Feel free to use the names you are comfortable with in your app.

**Extra hint ðŸ’¡**: `update()` would be similar to your `reducer()`. ðŸ˜‰

## API

- `createApp({ init, update, view, subscriptions })`: Create an app. This function returns a React component you can use in your JSX as a top level element or child.
- `useSendMsg()`: A hook to get the `sendMsg()` function, to trigger `update()`. It's mainly for convenience, so you don't have to pass down `sendMsg()` in deep component hierarchies. Think of `sendMsg()` like `dispatch()`.
